1. Write views for:
   - Homepage.
   - Category and product listings.
   - Product detail page.
   - Cart and checkout.
   - User login, registration, and profile management.
2. Map views to URLs in the app’s `urls.py`.

---

### **6. Set Up Static and Media Files**
1. Configure `STATIC_URL` and `MEDIA_URL` in `settings.py`.
2. Collect static files and handle media uploads for product images.
3. Use the `ImageField` in the product model for image uploads.

   - Set up a domain and SSL.

---

### **12. Maintenance and Scaling**
1. Monitor application performance.
2. Add new features like product reviews, wishlists, or a search functionality.
3. Gather feedback and iterate on the design and functionality.
